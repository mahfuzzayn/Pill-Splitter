## **Project Overview**

PillSplitter is a lightweight web application built with vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML that lets users visually split pills in different waysâ€”vertically, horizontally, or as a stack. Depending on the cursor direction, a pill can be cut into halves (vertical or horizontal) or into four equal pieces when both directions are applied, providing an interactive and simple demonstration of pill splitting.
